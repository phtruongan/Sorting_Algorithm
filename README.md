# Sorting_Algorithm
They are several C++ classes that implement some popular algorithms about sorting.
There are four popular sorting algorithms:
- Simple sorts:
	- InsertionSort
	- SelectionSort
- Efficient sorts (recently used for distributed systems)
	- MergeSort
	- HeapSort
	- QuickSort
- Bubble sort and variants
	- BubbleSort
	- ShellSort ( we implement based on gap sequence of Marcin Ciura)
- Distribution sort (also for distributed systems)
	- not implemented yet
